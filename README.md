# Develop using AI powered code suggestions using GitHub Copilot and VS Code

<!--step0

GitHub Copilot can help you code by offering autocomplete-style suggestions. You can learn how GitHub Copilot works, and what to consider while using GitHub Copilot. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.


- **Who this is for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, Software development managers, Testers
- **What you'll learn**: How to install Copilit into a Codespace, accept suggestions from code, accept suggestions from comments
- **What you'll build**: Javascript files that will have code generated by Copilot AI for code and comment suggestions
- **Prerequisites**: To use GitHub Copilot you must have an active GitHub Copilot subscription. Sign up for 60 days free [Copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
- **Timing**: This course is four steps long and can be completed in under an hour

3. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repositoryâ€”private repositories will use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

<summary><h2>Step 1: Leverage Codespaces with VS Code for Copilot</h2></summary>

_Welcome to "Develop using AI powered code suggestions using GitHub Copilot and VS Code"! :wave:_

**Copilot works with many code editors including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDE and Veovim. This skill will focus on leveraging GitHub Codespaces with Copilot. It is recomended you complete the GitHub skill [Codespaces](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) before moving foroward with this skill.**
 
Additionally GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language

Using Copilot inside a Codespace shows just how easy it is to get up and running with GitHub's suite of [Collaborative Coding](https://github.com/features#features-collaboration) tools.  

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Copilot inside a Codespace

**We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.**

1. Navigating back to your **Code** tab of your repository, click the **Add file** drop-down button, and then click `Create new file`.
2. Type or paste the following in the empty text field prompt to name your file.
```
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```
3. In the body of the new **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json** file, add the following content:
```
{
    // Name this configuration
    "name": "Codespace for Skills!",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "GitHub.copilot"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
3. Click **Commit changes** and then select **Commit changes directly to the `main` branch**.
4. Create a new codespace by navigating to the landing page of your repository.
5. Click the **Code** button located in the middle of the page.
6. Click the **Codespaces** tab on the box that pops up.
7. Click the **Create codespace on main** button.

   **Wait about 2 minutes for the codespace to spin itself up.**

8. Verify your codespace is running. The browser should contain a VS Code web-based editor and a terminal should be present such as the below:

<summary><h2>Step 2: Seeing AI code suggestions in a Javascript file!</h2></summary>

_Nice work! :tada: You created a Codesapce and have Copilot installed!_

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following samples are in JavaScript, but other languages will work similarly.

Let's try this out utilizing Javascript for Copilot.
 
### :keyboard: Activity: Add a Javascript file and start writing code

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file. Note: If you closed the Codespace from above please open it back up or create a new Codespace.
2. Name the file `skills.js`
3. Verify your new file looks like:
 ![Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 9 21 34 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26442605/224105906-d1beb531-b747-4c7a-85ba-a12526488422.png)
4. In the `skills.js` file, type the following function header. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text, as shown below. The exact suggestion may vary.
 ```
 function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
 ```
5.Accept the suggestion, press `Tab`.
 
### :keyboard: Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace

1. Use the VS Code source control tab to add the file and push back to the repository:
2. In the message box type:
```
Copilot first commit
```
3. Select the arrow next to the `Commit` drop down 
4. Select `commit and sync. Should look like this:
 ![Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 11 14 32 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26442605/224131002-0efd82b4-a9d7-4d79-be68-60b34c30a68f.png)
5. Select `Yes` when asked to `Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?`.
6. Select`Ok, dont show again` when prompted for: `This action will pull and push commits from and to "origin/main".`

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**

_Nice work Seeing AI code suggestions in a Javascript file :sparkles:_
 
You may not want any of the initial suggestions GitHub Copilot offers. GitHub Copilot will show you multiple suggestions in a new tab.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add another Javascript method and view all suggestions

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, select the `skills.js` file. Note: If you closed the Codespace from above please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

_Nicely done utilzing the Copilot tab!_ :partying_face:

You now have leveraged the Copilot quick tab auto-suggest as well as the Copilot hub to accept AI generaged suggestions. 

Now lets see how you can leverage comments to generate Copilot suggestions!

### :keyboard: Activity: Generate Copilot suggested code from comments.

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file. Note: If you closed the Codespace from above please open it back up or create a new Codespace.
2. Name the file `comments.js`
3. Type the following comments into the file:
 ```
 // Create a web server
 ```
4. Press `enter` to go to a new line
5. Copilot will suggest a code block.
6. Hover over the red squggly and select the `...`
7. Click `Open GitHub Copilot`. Copilot will synthesise around 10 different code suggestions. You should see somethig like this:
8. Find a solution you like and click `Accept Solution`. 7. Your `skills.js` file will be updated with your solution.
 
### :keyboard: Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace

1. Use the VS Code source control tab to add the file and push back to the repository:
2. In the message box type:
```
Copilot third commit
```
3. Select the arrow next to the `Commit` drop down 
4. Select `commit and sync. Should look like this:
